<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h2>


Unit 1, Outcome 2 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello<br><br>

Yes, I'm satisfied. Visual Studio Code is essential for coding programmers. However, after installing, Visual Studio Code is required additional installation such as Python, html, etc.<br>
On the other hand, repl.it is more convenient to use online. We can code easily on the Internet without installing the program and see the results immediately. It was especially useful when I go out, because I could continue to code with other computers.<br>
Trello was a great program for time management and task management. Because it's web-based, therefore we don't need to install the program and it's saved automatically. Also there are many good functions such as real-time linkage, synchronization, and auto update. Especially when I worked on the same project with my team members, I liked it as a collaboration tool.<br><br>



Unit 1, Outcome 2 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello<br><br>

Visual Studio Code is very relevant for this project. Because it's simple, intuitive and basic features are really useful. <br>So it was great for working on IT projects. Also, we can easily find any errors in CSS documents through VSC. It is also convenient to find the same phrase without scrolling through the sidebar position indicator. Furthermore, it's very stable and I'm satisfied with the speed. It's also a Microsoft product, so it's reliable. Above all, I liked this program because it was free.<br>
On the other hand, Trello is very appropriate to collaborate with Team when we have a same projects and tasks. Especially through "To do", "Doing", and "Done", it can show us at a glance the status of my current job completion. Therefore, it clearly shows what I have completed and what I have to do in the future. So it helps me focus on it. This is very appropriate.

Unit 1, Outcome 2 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?<br><br>

Actually I'm not satisfied with this project outcome. Because it is still quite a rudimentary website. Especially, the purpose of the website does not stand out accurately. If so, visitors will also lose interest in the website and the purpose and direction of the visit. Also there are no buttons on the homepage such as signup/login/logout/membership etc. I have to pursue this, but at the moment it is hard for me. Category structure is too simple. Furthermore, there is also a significant lack of good photos and videos to help visitors understand. In my opinion, a lot of modifications are needed.


<br><br>
Unit 1, Outcome 2 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project<br><br>

It seems to be better if we give clearer information to visitors and consider the convenience of their use of it. For that reason, I hope the site map is needed here. Also, we plan to reorganize the main homepage so that the most important contents of the website can be clearly imprinted on a visitor's mind. In addition, it will be more convenient to link blogs or social media to this web pages. Finally, we will add as high quality images and videos as possible so that they are not distorted.
<br><br>


Unit 1, Outcome 2 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
<br><br>
We need a screen rearrangement and a simple design to suit the purpose of the visitor's interest. It also needs to be more intuitive, logical, and preferably concise as possible. Also, slightly the menu does not convey the meaning correctly, so we need to modify the menu again properly. Additionally, links need to be reconfigured so that they can be visually highlighted. Finally, we need to check if there are any copyright violations such as images and fonts.
