<h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1</h2>
Unit 2, Outcome 1.1 Describe the content and layout for each page<br><br>
I chose to have a simple style for my website, with one outcome per page. I prefer the stripped back approach as it clean and professional looking. It gave me time to focus on more important roles in the project such as writing answers and keeping on top of project mangaement techniques. Each question and  answer is laid out in an easy-to-read way, with black Arial font. I have used a bit of colour in my headings.<br><br>

Unit 2, Outcome 1 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites<br><br>

Because copyright acts on all online or offline publications we publish, it certainly affects websites.<br>
The law in the UK is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and it protects original creations involving literary work, music, art, film, and sound .[1]<br>
For example, posting pictures taken by another person, writing by another person, videos of another person, music by another person without permission are illegal and are subject to legal restrictions.<br>
Therefore, we should always get permission from the original author. Also we can also link the original site with permission.<br>

Unit 2, Outcome 1 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them<br><br>

There are various problems when people with disabilities use websites.<br>
But the most representative problem is when blind people use websites.<br>
But the growing awareness of the use of websites by people with disabilities, and the continuing development of various technologies for them, these two are very encouraging.<br>
Three methods can be used for the visually impaired people.<br>
The first method is to zoom in on the screen. If they have residual vision left, the screen enlargement can help them.<br>
The second method is to sound out contents on the monitor. There is also inputting and running through voice sound on their computer.<br>
Thirdly, there is a way to use a very special braille terminal device with a refreshable braille display to check the contents. However, it costs a lot of money.<br>
Of the three methods, using a computer with sound is the least expensive.<br>
Also, it has nothing to do with the existence of residual vision or ability to decipher braille. Therefore, it is the most widely used method of using computer for blind people.<br>
But I don't think this is necessary for hearing impaired people because they can see it.<br><br>
