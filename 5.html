<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3</h2>


Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
<br><br>
It is much faster and more efficient to get information through websites before going to the company to get it. However, there are disadvantages of not being able to see or meet people in person. It may be faster to search with Wikipedia or search engine than to refer to an encyclopedia. Writing on paper takes a long time and is difficult to correct. However, if we use processing software such as MS-Word, we can reduce and correct mistakes and store them in electronic documents. Common letters often help to establish relationships. However, e-mail send immediately and store digitally. While storing photos and videos physically is costly and feared to be lost, storing them digitally reduces the risk of losing them. Above all, when we work for making website as a team, IT tools have a lot of advantages, for example collecting information, photos, music, or videos, especially in terms of sharing and collaboration on the cloud service these days.

Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
<br><br>
Acquiring new OS(Operating System) technology or learning how to use new computer programs can greatly improve productivity and efficiency. If our company uses appropriate IT tools that allow team members to work together, it's much easier to complete our task done. It is also a good idea to store data on a physical storage or a virtual storage(cloud service) and share it with colleagues. Word processing, spread sheets, and presentations tools are great ways to make our business more efficient. E-mail marketing, social networks service, Google analytics, SEO, website publishing and so on are really beneficial for promoting and selling item's of company products. In addition, time management and human resources management can be utilized through IT technologies for best results.

Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
<br><br>
After the idea meeting, we share final outcome through Slack. We also get feedback from our team members privately or publicly through Slack. Slack was very useful for chatting, sharing for ideas and information for groups and communities. In addition, useful materials are printed and stored in pdf. We also can keep our favorite websites in the bookmark.
When we are doing a team project, we need to share our code. In this case, it's very useful to do it on GitHube. That is, GitHub is a source code sharing and management service for software development projects. Therefore, as a developer, team members can access source code and manage bugs. Commit (save), push (actually upload), and branch (maintenance) features are also very useful.

Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
<br><br>
Almost everything is being digitized these days. Many people prefer online shopping to visiting stores. Marketing has also moved to digital media. As a result, digital testing has become much more important than ever. These digital tests are linked to good impressions of visitors. It also gives users a more comfortable use experience.This is why developers need to perform digital testing to detect problems early and correct them quickly. The areas we are going to test are functional, usability, performance, etc. In particular, it is important to ensure that the screen is displayed well without any problems. All buttons must be tested to ensure they are working fine and scrolling is working well. If we see that the IT device or software has problem, we should correct it appropriately. Also we need to make sure that there are no problems when users type text. If problems arise with these tests, developers should try to quickly check source code and fix problems to resolve them quickly. Finally, we need to see if IT device or software is vulnerable to viruses. If it is difficult to modify it, we need to ask a more skillful developer for help.
